# NFQ-Task-1
NFQ Task 1 for programming academy
I chose task 1, because I want to become a full-stack programmer, so I thought to myself: "let's start with back-end". Back-end was unfamiliar to me, but lots of reading and watching tutorials helped me to understand basics of back-end and complete Task 1. I used MariaDB, php, wrote SQL queries and for front-end I mainly used Bootstrap v3. All in all, I tried my best :D
